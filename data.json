      "I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Stanford Graduate School of Business, working with Professor Michele J. Gelfand. My research examines human prosocial behavior—including trust, cooperation, and charitable giving—and punishment across cultures, investigating how social structures shape interpersonal behaviors through multi-level analyses of individual and group dynamics.",
      "I received my Ph.D. in Social Psychology from Beijing Normal University (2024), where I studied under Professor Kou Yu. My dissertation explored how economic inequality influences philanthropy. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam with Professor Daniel Balliet."
